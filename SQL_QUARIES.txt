What is Database?

   Database is the collection  of data in format that can be easily accessed(Digital).

   A Software application used to managed our Database is called DBMS(Database Management System).

What is SQL?(Structured query language)

   SQL is programming language used to interact with relational databases.

    it is used to perform CRUD operations:
            Create
            Read
            Update
            delete

THERE ARE SOME CONSTRAINTS WE USE IN CREATION OF DATABASE
          The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:

             PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
             NOT NULL -    Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
             UNIQUE -      Ensures that all values in a column are different
             FOREIGN KEY - Refers to the primary key of another table.  there can be multiple FKs IT can have duplicate & null values
             CHECK -       Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
             DEFAULT -     Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
             CREATE INDEX -Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly


Some of The Most Important SQL Commands:-

             SELECT -          extracts data from a database
             UPDATE -          updates data in a database
             DELETE -          deletes data from a database
             INSERT INTO -     inserts new data into a database
             CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
             ALTER DATABASE -  modifies a database
             CREATE TABLE -    creates a new table
             ALTER TABLE -     modifies a table
             DROP TABLE -      deletes a table
             CREATE INDEX -    creates an index (search key)
             DROP INDEX -      deletes an index


Types of SQL Commands:-

         DDL (Data Definition Language):
                CREATE: Creates a new table or database.
                ALTER: Modifies an existing database object.
                DROP: Deletes an entire table, database, or other objects.
                TRUNCATE: Removes all records from a table, deleting the space allocated for the records.

         DQL â€“ Data Query Language
                SELECT: It is used to retrieve data from the database

         DML (Data Manipulation Language):
                INSERT: Adds new data to a table.
                UPDATE: Modifies existing data within a table.
                DELETE: Removes data from a table.

         DCL (Data Control Language):
                GRANT: Gives users access privileges to the database.
                REVOKE: Removes access privileges given with the GRANT command.

         TCL (Transaction Control Language):
                COMMIT: Saves all changes made in the current transaction.
                ROLLBACK: Restores the database to the last committed state.
                SAVEPOINT: Sets a savepoint within a transaction.
                SET TRANSACTION: Places a name on a transaction.

NOTE:---
         MOST OF THE TIME WE USE "DDL, DQL, DML" 

         BUT FOR PROJECTS IN WHICH WE HAVE TO GIVE ACCESS TO ONE PERSON AND ANOTHER ACCESS GIVEN IN OTHER PERSON
         WE USE "DCL"

         AND FOR ADVANCE SQL QUERY WE USE "TCL"



Create database:-
         CREATE DATABASE db_name;

Drop/ Delete database:-
         drop database db_name;

TO use the Database:-
         USE db_name;



   {{{ First of all we use the database where we have to create table. 
    let suppose database name is "College" and table name is "student"}}}

               table_name = student

To Create table:-

     use college;
        create table table_name(
           column_name1 datatype constraint,
           column_name2 datatype constraint
           column_name3 datatype constraint
           );
           
           example:-
              create table student(
                 rollno int primary key,
                 name varchar(50),
                 age int not null
                );

DROP/DELETE TABLE:
          drop table student;

VIEW ALL DATA OF TABLE :-
          select * from student;

INSERT INTO TABLE:-
          insert into student
            ( columnName1, columnName2 )  
          values
            (col1_v1, col2_v2) 
            (col1_v1, col2_v2)     
           
    columnName1=rollno
    columnName2=name

          insert into student
             (rollno, name)
          values
             (01, "Amardeep"),
             (02, "Krishna");
